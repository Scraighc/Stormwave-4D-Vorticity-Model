# StormWave 4D Research Dashboard Prototype

Browser-based proof-of-concept for StormWave 4D — a simulated 4D storm scanning interface with:
- Circular radar sweep animation
- Metrics (debris concentration, rotation strength, vorticity, hail probability)
- Color-coded alerts
- Tricorder-style layout

## Status
- Simulation only (fake live updates via JavaScript, based on case studies/radar shots)
- No real NEXRAD L2/L3 or mobile radar connection

## Free for Research & Extreme Testing
Full free use granted for research/educational purposes.  
Ideal for teams with mobile radar access (e.g., Reed Timmer / Team Dominator) who can replace simulation with real data.

## How to Run
- Click index.html → Raw → Right-click → Save link as .html
- Open in browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended) — works offline
- Watch the sweep & fake metric updates

Feedback, forks, results, or extreme field tests welcome!
